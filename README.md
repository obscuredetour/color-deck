# Color Deck
Color Deck is a HSL driven color palette collector [progressive web app](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) made for humans.

There are quite a few color tools out there. However, none focus on HSL. It is arguably the easiest method for humans to view relationships between colors. Many color tools also arbitrarily decide how many colors should be in a palette or series. Color Deck sets out to correct these issues. Learn why [HSL is great](https://github.com/imathis/hsl-picker/).

## Thanks to others

Would like to thank [James Daniel](https://github.com/jaames) for his Color Picker [iro.js](https://iro.js.org/). This project would have been a lot more difficult had I not found [iro.js](https://iro.js.org/) and been witness to his great documentation.

[Zen Rocha](https://github.com/zenorocha) for creating [clipboard.js](https://clipboardjs.com/) and making my *'click to copy'* feature so much easier.

[Lea Verou's](http://lea.verou.me/) color tool [contrast-ratio.com](https://contrast-ratio.com) is in use all the time and helped inspire the desire to copy color values in various formats with ease. (So you can paste them in here!)

The guys over at [Refactoring UI](https://refactoringui.com/) deserve a mention for their love of HSL and the Color chapter in their [book](https://refactoringui.com/book/). Funny and informative, but ultimately, it helped foster my distaste for color pickers that allow you to save *just* 5 colors at a time.
